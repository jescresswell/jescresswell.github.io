Kinematic space can be used as an intermediate step in the AdS/CFT dictionary and lends itself naturally to the description of diffeomorphism invariant quantities. In this work conical defect spacetimes are considered and a duality is established between partial OPE blocks and bulk fields integrated over individual geodesics, minimal or non-minimal.
