The manifold hypothesis states that data lies on an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension. We argue that this hypothesis does not properly capture the low-dimensional structure typically present in data, and we put forth the union of manifolds hypothesis, which accommodates the existence of non-constant intrinsic dimensions. We empirically verify this hypothesis on commonly-used image datasets, and show that classes with higher intrinsic dimensions are harder to classify.
