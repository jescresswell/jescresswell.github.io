Negativity is an entanglement monotone frequently used to quantify entanglement in bipartite states. We develop techniques in the calculus of complex, patterned matrices and use them to conduct a perturbative analysis of negativity in terms of arbitrary variations of the density operator. Our methods are well suited to study the growth and decay of entanglement in a wide range of physical systems, including the generic linear growth of entanglement in many-body systems, and have broad relevance to many functions of quantum states and observables.
