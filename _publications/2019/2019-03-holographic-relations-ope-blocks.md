We study the holographic duality between boundary OPE blocks and geodesic integrated bulk fields in quotients of AdS3 dual to excited CFT states. The quotient geometries exhibit non-minimal geodesics between pairs of spacelike separated boundary points which modify the OPE block duality. We decompose OPE blocks into quotient invariant operators and propose a duality with bulk fields integrated over individual geodesics, minimal or non-minimal.
