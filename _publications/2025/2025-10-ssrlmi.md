Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network, stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound, we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization, making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.
