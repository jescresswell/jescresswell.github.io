In this paper we use Dirac’s method to impose the Lorenz gauge condition in a general four-dimensional conformally flat spacetime and find that there is no particle production. We show that in cosmological spacetimes with dimension D≠4 there will be particle production when the scale factor changes, and we calculate the particle production due to a sudden change.
