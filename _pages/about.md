I am a Staff Research Machine Learning Scientist with Layer 6 AI at TD, and lead the development of Trustworthy AI.

Designing trustworthy machine learning models is crucial in highly regulated industries like banking and healthcare. My research group at Layer 6 AI is advancing TD's capabilities in privacy, fairness, robustness, and explainability, both for predictive and generative AI.

I have deep expertise in generative modelling - especially through the lens of the manifold hypothesis - conformal prediction, self-supervised learning, differential privacy, and federated learning.
