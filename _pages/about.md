I am a Sr. Machine Learning Scientist with Layer 6 AI at TD. On the applied side, I lead the development of credit risk ML models for TD, while in research I focus on privacy and generative modelling.

Privacy enhancing technologies are crucial for developing and deploying machine learning models in highly regulated industries like banking and healthcare. My research group at Layer 6 AI is advancing TD's capabilities in federated learning, augmented by differential privacy.

My current interest in generative modeling is how to properly account for the implications of the manifold hypothesis - that high-dimensional natural data belong to low-dimensional manifolds. To accurately represent natural data, generative models should learn both manifold structure and the distribution of data on the manifold. My work with our group at Layer 6 AI is aimed at developing rigorous techniques that solve foundational problems in generative modeling.
